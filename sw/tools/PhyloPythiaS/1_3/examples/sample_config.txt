#OR a file with ncbi taxon ids (one id per line) to create a tree from
TREE_FILE:
#Taxonomic ranks (comma separated, no space) starting at the lowest rank. Please make sure that "root" is there at the end.

###### Input space options #####
#a directory with sample specific fasta files (file names must start with appropriate organism/species ncbi taxonomic id)
#leave empty if you don't have any

###### Training options #####
#C values for SVM, if single value is given then models will be build with that value.
#If comma separated (no space) values are given then cross-validation will be performed.
#If a single value is provided, all models will be built with it. Our experience shows that in general
#values less than 1 (e.g. 0.01 and 0.1) do not provide good models.
