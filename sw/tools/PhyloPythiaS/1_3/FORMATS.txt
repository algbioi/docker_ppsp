This document explains different file formats used.

1. Newick format

Its a machine readable format for trees. See the following website for details;

http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/newicktree.html

For the current binaries every node must be named with a integer value (string names are not
supported). Moreover the tree must be rooted and the root node should also have an integer name.

Example newick tree: ((5,6,7)2,(8)3,4)1;


2. SVMlight format

The binaries svm_phylo_learn svm_phylo_classify* and svm_phylo_cv understand the files in SVMlight format;

http://svmlight.joachims.org

There is one line for every example. Every line starts with a label, which in the present context corresponds
to one of the nodes in the newick tree. The label is followed with a sparse vector representation. Each line can
optionally end with a comment starting with the character "#".


3. FASTA format

Its a very popular format to store sequences;

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format

The fasta2kmers binary assumes the input file to be in this format. This binary has a restriction that sequence
should not have more than 50,000 characters in one line.

4. PhyloPythiaS raw output format

Every line of this output file contains several tab separated entries. The first entry being the fasta header of the
predicted sequence and 5th entry is its prediction.

5. PhyloPythia output format

This file format is also tab separated. It starts with some comment lines (6 to be specific) and follows one line per
predicted sequence. Here the first entry is the fasta header followed by the NCBI taxonomy names for the predicted
lineage.
